    <h2>Warranty Policy</h2>
    <p>PhoneSale's warranty policy ensures coverage for defects in material, design, and workmanship after the purchase of the product.</p>
    
    <h3>Warranty Period:</h3>
    <p>The main device is covered for 12 months from the date of receipt, free of charge. Accessories and other electronic devices also have a 12-month warranty starting from the purchase date.</p>

    <h3>Warranty Repairs:</h3>
    <p>Warranty repairs are handled by our service centers. If the product was purchased from a third-party seller, the seller's warranty terms apply. The original invoice is required to verify the serial number and validate the warranty period for services.</p>

    <p>The warranty repair period is twenty-one (21) working days, from the date of picking up the product from the customer until it is dispatched back.</p>

    <h3>Coverage and Conditions:</h3>
    <p>Not all products include warranty benefits; always check the product listing for details. Repair or replacement under warranty does not extend or renew the warranty period, which adheres to the device manufacturer's terms. If a product cannot be repaired and is still under the manufacturer's warranty, a replacement will be issued or, if unavailable, a refund of 85% will be provided after deducting 15% for restocking.</p>

    <p>To request warranty services for a defect within the warranty period, submit a request through our WhatsApp (+971566053401) or Email (support@phonesale.org). Our warranty team will contact you within 24 hours for claim validation and troubleshooting. You will need to provide pictures of the product from all angles, including the IMEI/Serial number.</p>

    <p>Ensure the item is packed in its original box or wrapped safely to avoid damage during transit. PhoneSale is not responsible for damages due to unsafe packaging, and such items will be returned without servicing.</p>

    <h3>Warranty Details:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Seller: PhoneSale</li>
        <li>Warranty Duration: 12 Months (UAE)</li>
        <li>Number of Claims per Issue Type: 3</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Policy:</h3>
    <p>Customers are responsible for backing up personal data and information on devices. Ensure FMI is switched off and lock/passwords are removed before servicing. The time taken to obtain device information or customer approval is not included in the Turn Around Time (TAT) of the repair process.</p>

    <p>By submitting your item for repair, you consent to the use of your contact details as required in connection with the repair service. Confirm all information provided during the warranty claim is correct. Remove screen protectors to facilitate service.</p>

    <p>The warranty does not cover defects or damage resulting from misuse, non-adherence to instructions, liquid spills, unauthorized repairs, or items not covered under the warranty conditions.</p>

    <h3>Delivery Policy:</h3>
    <p>Items covered by warranty are shipped at AED 50. PhoneSale is not responsible for damages during shipping to us. Ensure items are packed safely in the original box or appropriate wrapping. Provide all corresponding accessories to the courier during pickup, including earphones, battery, and charge carrier.</p>
